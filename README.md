#### PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Earlier to get a job, the applicant has to go to the company’s office and have to fill the form. This process was slow, costly, and tiresome for the applicant and the HR department of the company. The condition is worsened when there is an urgent need for an employee. There is also a sudden increase in the job vacancies and using the above process it will be quite difficult to handle the increasing amount of applications.
To overcome these problems we will develop an application to search the Jobs for your preferred locations. This application can be used by job seekers and HR’s(or the companies) to apply and post new jobs respectively.

#### FUNCTIONALITIES

  1) Sign In / Sign Up as a job seeker or a company’s representative

  4) Job seekers can  search jobs with various filters
  5) Job seekers can apply for job
